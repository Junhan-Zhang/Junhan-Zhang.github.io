Hello! My name is **Junhan Zhang (张峻涵)**. I am an incoming PhD student at Nanyang Technological University, where I will be supervised by Prof. [Jue Wang](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/entities/person/Wang-Jue). My research lies at the intersection of science policy, innovation management, and research evaluation, with a particular interest in how basic and applied research interact in shaping scientific outcomes. Prior to joining NTU, I completed my M.Sc. in Intellectual Property Management at Tongji University, under the supervision of Prof. [Xuhua Chang](https://sicip.tongji.edu.cn/13/dc/c13550a136156/page.htm). I also hold a B.Sc. in Geophysics from Tongji University, where I was fortunate to be mentored by Prof. [Mei Xue](https://mgg.tongji.edu.cn/25/ac/c22875a206252/page.htm), Prof. [Nan Wu](https://mgg.tongji.edu.cn/25/a8/c22871a206248/page.htm), and Prof. [Guangfa Zhong](https://ocean.tongji.edu.cn/space/gfz/).

My academic journey has taken me from earth sciences to science policy, and I remain deeply curious about how knowledge evolves across disciplines, institutions, and national contexts.

You can find my CV [*here*](../files/Junhan_Zhang_CV_2025.pdf).
